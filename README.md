# CSCB58Project - Brain's Bot

This is a repository for our CSCB58 - Computer Organization final project.

The materials we used were a DE2-Board, a bread board, transistors, wires, Knex pieces for the frame and a HC-SR04.

Our project involves a bot that drives on a flat surface until it discovers an obstacle. When an obstacle is detected the bot stops and turns in order to avoid it. Once the obstacle is no longer there, the bot continues to drive.

Code is written using verilog.
